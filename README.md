# Image Editor - A Flask App with OpenCV
This is a lightweight image editor web application built with Flask (Python framework) and OpenCV (computer vision library). It allows users to upload images and perform basic editing tasks.

# Technologies Used
Flask: A lightweight web framework for building web applications in Python.
Python: A general-purpose programming language known for its readability and versatility.
OpenCV (cv2): An open-source library for computer vision tasks, including image processing.
Features
Upload images in various formats (JPG, PNG, etc.).
Convert images to different formats: JPG, PNG, and grayscale.
Generate a basic webpage displaying the processed image.
How to Run
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python (version 3.x recommended) and pip (package installer) installed on your system. You can download them from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

# Install Dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to install required libraries:

Bash
pip install Flask opencv-python
Use code with caution.
Run the Application: Make sure you have a Python file containing your Flask app code (e.g., app.py). In the terminal, execute the following command:

Bash
python app.py
Use code with caution.
This will typically start the development server and display information on the terminal about the port the application is running on (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

# Usage
Open a web browser and navigate to the address displayed on the terminal (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
The application should display a homepage with an upload form.
Select the image file you want to edit and choose the desired operation (convert to JPG, PNG, grayscale, or webpage).
Click the "Upload" button.
The application will process the image and display a success message with a link to the processed image or webpage.
